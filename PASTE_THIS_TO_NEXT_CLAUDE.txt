===== COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE AND PASTE TO NEXT CLAUDE =====

Hi! I'm continuing the Interactive Video Campaign Builder project.

PROJECT LOCATION: C:\Users\PCS\code\int-video
GITHUB: https://github.com/anup1969/int-video

üìã CONTEXT FILES TO READ (IN ORDER):
1. C:\Users\PCS\OneDrive\Desktop\int video claude code\project instructions.txt (original requirements - READ FIRST!)
2. C:\Users\PCS\code\int-video\HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_CLAUDE.md (complete session 1 handoff - READ SECOND!)
3. C:\Users\PCS\code\int-video\SESSION_SUMMARY.md (session overview)

‚úÖ CURRENT STATUS (Session 1 Complete - Oct 29, 2025):

**Phase 1 & 2: 100% COMPLETE!** üéâ

‚úÖ Complete Next.js 14 app with all React components (30+ files)
‚úÖ Visual Flow Builder working perfectly (drag-and-drop, 7 answer types, logic branching)
‚úÖ **Save/Load Integration COMPLETE** - campaigns save to & load from database
‚úÖ **Auto-Save Feature WORKING** - saves every 30 seconds automatically
‚úÖ **Video Upload System COMPLETE** - uploads to Supabase Storage with progress indicator
‚úÖ Database schema ready (3 tables: campaigns, steps, connections)
‚úÖ All API routes working (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE campaigns, save state, upload video)
‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub (8 commits)
‚úÖ Build successful and tested
‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation (10 files)

üìä DEPLOYMENT STATUS (User Action Required):

Check with user first:
[ ] Database setup in Supabase - User needs to run: supabase/setup.sql (5 min)
[ ] Netlify connected & deployed - User needs to follow: COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_NOW.md (5 min)

If user hasn't deployed yet: Help them deploy following COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_NOW.md
If user has deployed: Test the live site first before building new features!

üéØ WHAT I NEED NOW (Session 2 - Phase 3):

**Campaign Management Dashboard** (Priority 1)

Build a dashboard page to manage multiple campaigns:
1. Dashboard page at /dashboard
   - List all campaigns in card/grid view
   - Show campaign metadata (date, status, step count)
   - Create new campaign button
   - Load campaign button

2. Campaign Card Component
   - Thumbnail preview
   - Campaign name
   - Status indicator (draft/active/paused)
   - Quick actions (edit, duplicate, delete)
   - Last modified date

3. Campaign Actions
   - Edit campaign name inline
   - Duplicate campaign
   - Delete campaign (with confirmation)
   - Archive campaign

4. Integration with FlowBuilder
   - Add URL parameter support (?campaign=id)
   - Load campaign automatically from URL
   - Navigate between dashboard and builder

üìå IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

- FlowBuilder.js already has saveCampaign() and loadCampaign() functions working
- API endpoints exist: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/campaigns and /api/campaigns/[id]
- Database tables are ready (once user runs setup.sql)
- Just need to build the UI layer for campaign management

‚úã MY PREFERENCES (Always Follow):

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always explain what you understand BEFORE implementing
2. Show token usage regularly (budget wisely)
3. I'm a PM (non-technical) - guide me step-by-step
4. Read HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_CLAUDE.md thoroughly before starting
5. Test existing features before building new ones
6. Update README/handoff docs for next session if tokens run low

üíª TECH STACK:

- Frontend: React 18 + Next.js 14 (Pages Router) + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API Routes
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Storage: Supabase Storage (for videos)
- Deployment: Netlify
- GitHub: https://github.com/anup1969/int-video

üîë CREDENTIALS (Full details in project instructions.txt):

- Supabase URL: https://uwzzdxroqqynmqkmwlpk.supabase.co
- Supabase Anon Key: [in project instructions.txt]
- Supabase Service Role Key: [in project instructions.txt]
- Netlify site name: gtintvideo
- GitHub repo: anup1969/int-video

üìÅ KEY FILES YOU'LL WORK WITH:

Currently Working:
- components/builder/FlowBuilder.js (save/load integrated)
- components/builder/Header.js (save button with status)
- components/builder/VideoUpload.js (video upload)
- pages/api/campaigns/* (all API routes)

Need to Create:
- pages/dashboard.js (main dashboard page)
- components/dashboard/CampaignCard.js (campaign cards)
- components/dashboard/CampaignGrid.js (grid layout)

üéØ SESSION 2 ESTIMATED TOKEN USAGE:

Campaign Management Dashboard: ~30,000-40,000 tokens
Testing & Bug Fixes: ~5,000 tokens
Documentation Updates: ~5,000 tokens
Total: ~40,000-50,000 tokens

üìä TOKEN USAGE SESSION 1: 136,500 / 200,000 (68.25%)

üöÄ READY TO START?

First, ask me:
1. "Have you deployed the site to Netlify yet?"
2. "Have you run the database setup in Supabase?"
3. "Can you test save/load on the live site?"

Then proceed based on my answers!
