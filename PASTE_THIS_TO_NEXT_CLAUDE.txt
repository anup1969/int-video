===== COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE AND PASTE TO NEXT CLAUDE =====

Hi! I'm continuing the Interactive Video Campaign Builder project from the previous session.

PROJECT LOCATION: C:\Users\PCS\code\int-video

CONTEXT FILES TO READ:
1. C:\Users\PCS\OneDrive\Desktop\int video claude code\project instructions.txt (original requirements - READ FIRST!)
2. C:\Users\PCS\code\int-video\HANDOFF_TO_NEXT_CLAUDE.md (complete handoff document - READ SECOND!)
3. C:\Users\PCS\code\int-video\QUICK_START.md (current status summary)

WHAT'S BEEN DONE (Session 1 - Oct 29):
✅ Complete Next.js app with all React components (30+ files)
✅ Visual Flow Builder working perfectly (tested locally)
✅ Database schema created (3 tables: campaigns, steps, connections)
✅ SQL migration files ready in supabase/setup.sql
✅ API routes created (CRUD operations)
✅ Supabase client configured
✅ Git repository initialized (3 commits)
✅ Netlify configuration ready
✅ Comprehensive documentation created

WHAT I'VE COMPLETED (User Actions):
[X] Database setup in Supabase - DONE / NOT DONE (pick one)
[X] .env.local created with Supabase keys - DONE / NOT DONE
[X] Code pushed to GitHub - DONE / NOT DONE
[X] Deployed to Netlify - DONE / NOT DONE

WHAT I NEED NOW (Session 2):
1. Integrate save/load functionality with Flow Builder
2. Add auto-save feature (every 30 seconds)
3. Test everything end-to-end
4. Fix any bugs found
5. Deploy updates to Netlify

MY PREFERENCES (Always Follow):
1. Always explain what you understand before implementing
2. Show token usage regularly
3. I'm a PM (non-technical), so guide me step-by-step
4. Keep updating README for next session if we run out of tokens
5. I have GitHub, Supabase MCP, and Netlify account integrated

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React 18 + Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API Routes + Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Deployment: Netlify
- Repo: https://github.com/anup1969/int-video

CREDENTIALS:
- Supabase URL: https://uwzzdxroqqynmqkmwlpk.supabase.co
- Supabase Anon Key: (in project instructions.txt)
- Netlify site: gtintvideo
